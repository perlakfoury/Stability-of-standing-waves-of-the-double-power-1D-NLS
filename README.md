## STABILITY OF STANDING WAVES OF THE DOUBLE POWER 1D NLS
P.-KFOURY-S.-LE-COZ-AND-T.-P.-TSAI

### The critical surface for stability/instability.
We analyzed the critical surface in (ω, p, q) separating instability from stability. To this aim, we first have implemented the calculation of J(ω,p,q). The function integrate.quad has been used to perform the integration. To estimate the critical ω at given (p, q), we have used the classical bisection method, which has the advantage of being very robust.

### Evolution for initial data close to standing waves.
We did numerical experiments for the stability/instability of solitary waves for NLS. For the experiments, we have used the Crank-Nicolson scheme with relaxation.
